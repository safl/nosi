"""
Smoke-test the baked qcow2 by booting it and asserting via SSH
==============================================================

Runs after ``img_gz_publish`` (and ``wsl_rootfs_publish`` for wsl shape). Boots
the just-baked image inside qemu on a copy-on-write overlay (the published
artefact stays untouched and first-boot characteristics are preserved),
SSHes into it as ``odus``, and runs a battery of assertions:

  * /etc/nosi-release exists, has NOSI_VERSION (non-unknown) and
    NOSI_VARIANT matching this build
  * /usr/local/bin/nosi-motd exists, executable, prints a banner whose
    first non-blank line starts with ``nosi``
  * /etc/motd is non-empty and contains ``nosi`` (the boot oneshot ran)
  * the "awesome tools" iommu, devbind, hugepages, ruff, pyright are all
    on PATH at /usr/local/bin
  * sshd is enabled for next boot (proven by ssh-in-itself, but recorded
    explicitly for the log)
  * ModemManager is NOT active (daemon-prune actually took)
  * Ubuntu only: snapd.socket is masked AND the snapd binary remains
    (soft-disabled, not purged)
Why a fresh boot of an overlay instead of guestmount-style inspection:
``99-motd.service`` renders /etc/motd on first boot, host keys regenerate
on first boot, our identity assertions transit ``cat /etc/nosi-release``
through the same sshd whose enablement we are testing. Static qcow2
inspection answers "did the apply step write file X?" but cannot answer
"will the next operator's first boot of this image actually work?".

To get ``odus`` past step 29's chage-expired password without burdening
the published artefact with CI-only credentials, the boot is fed a tiny
NoCloud seed.iso that authorises a per-run SSH key and unexpires odus.
The seed is built fresh in /tmp every run; the key never leaves the
runner.

Hard gate: a single failed assertion exits non-zero, which fails
``make build`` and skips the GHCR push for the variant.
