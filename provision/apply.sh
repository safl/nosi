# nosi/provision/apply.sh <variant> [--shape-only]
#
# Run the provision steps for <variant>. The variant is
# `<distro>-<version>-<shape>`, e.g.:
#
#   debian-13-headless    headless on Debian 13 (apt)
#   ubuntu-2604-headless  headless on Ubuntu 26.04 (apt)
#   ubuntu-2604-wsl       WSL2 rootfs on Ubuntu 26.04
#   ubuntu-2604-docker    OCI/container bootstrap on Ubuntu 26.04
#   fedora-44-desktop     desktop on Fedora 44 (dnf; Sway tiling stack)
#
# Steps come in three groups:
#
#   BASE_STEPS   distro/HW infrastructure every shape shares (release
#                stamp, tool installs, ssh, daemon-prune, ...). Identical
#                logic across shapes -- the part that would be pure
#                replication if every shape baked from scratch.
#   SHAPE_STEPS  the per-shape delta (Sway desktop, WSL GUI tools, docker
#                tooling). Each self-gates on NOSI_SHAPE, so the set is
#                safe to run wholesale: only the matching one does work.
#                These steps OWN their package installs (via
#                nosi_pkg_install), so the shape is fully defined here
#                rather than half here / half in cloud-init.
#   FINAL_STEPS  metadata capture + motd, run last so they reflect the
#                final installed inventory.
#
# Layered build model: the headless base bakes once (full run: BASE +
# SHAPE + FINAL; for headless no SHAPE step does anything). desktop /
# wsl / docker are DERIVED from that baked rootfs -- cijoe's
# derive_publish copies the base qcow2, chroots in, and runs
# `apply.sh <derived-variant> --shape-only`, which skips BASE_STEPS
# (already done in the base, and several aren't chroot-safe to re-run:
# the clock step would set the host clock, dkms/uname see the host
# kernel) and runs only SHAPE + FINAL. An operator on a vanilla VM runs
# the full `apply.sh <variant>` (no flag) and gets the complete result,
# so the "apply.sh reproduces the image" invariant holds in both
# contexts.
#
# Each step is independently idempotent, so apply.sh is too. Steps that
# touch kernel cmdline / initramfs may require a reboot to take effect.
