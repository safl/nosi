# Build a GENERIC (not host-only) initramfs on Fedora so a flashed image
# boots on ANY hardware.
#
# Fedora's dracut defaults to hostonly=yes: the initramfs it builds during
# our QEMU bake captures only the build VM's storage/driver profile plus a
# baked root cmdline (you can see the giveaway etc/cmdline.d/00-btrfs.conf
# inside the image's initramfs). nosi images are flashed to arbitrary bare
# metal (NVMe / AHCI / RAID HBAs / odd carriers), so a host-only initramfs
# can fail to find or mount the root filesystem on a box outside that
# profile and kernel-panic at boot ("unable to mount root fs"). It boots on
# hardware close to the build VM and panics on the rest -- which is exactly
# the "boots on some systems, panics on others" report this fixes.
#
# Debian / Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS already build a generic initramfs
# (update-initramfs defaults to MODULES=most), so this is dnf/Fedora-only.
#
# Two parts: drop hostonly="no" into dracut.conf.d so EVERY later dracut
# run is generic (this bake's later steps, kernel upgrades on the running
# box, and the desktop derive's kernels -- the conf travels in the rootfs);
# then regenerate-all once to rebuild the host-only initramfs the cloud base
# image already shipped. Runs before 15-nouveau-blacklist so that step's
# dracut --force is generic too.
