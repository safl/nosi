#
# Deterministic, NIC-agnostic networking, valid whether or not cloud-init
# runs on the target.
#
# Why this exists: nosi images are flashed to bare metal with NO
# cloud-init datasource. cloud-init runs exactly once -- inside the QEMU
# build VM -- where it renders /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml pinned to
# the BUILD VM's NIC (match: macaddress and/or set-name). The end-of-bake
# `cloud-init clean --logs --seed` does NOT remove that file (plain clean
# keeps generated netplan; only `clean --configs network` would), so the
# build VM's netplan ships verbatim. On the target box cloud-init finds
# no datasource and self-disables for the boot (`cloud-init status` =>
# disabled), so it never re-renders networking -- the stale, build-VM
# netplan is the ONLY network config present, and the real NIC (different
# MAC/name) never comes up. Observed: ubuntu-2404-headless dead on HW
# while ubuntu-2604-headless lived on the same box, purely by which pin
# each build happened to bake.
#
# Fix: own networking ourselves with ONE NIC-agnostic policy expressed in
# two places that carry the identical glob, so it holds in both worlds:
#
#   * /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90-nosi-network.cfg -- for every host where
#     cloud-init DOES run (VMs/cloud). cloud-init renders a correct,
#     glob-matched netplan from it; if that rendered file later lingers,
#     it is still useful (matched by NAME, not a dead MAC). As cloud-init
#     "system config", it sits BELOW datasource network-config in
#     priority, so a real cloud that pushes a static address still wins.
#   * /etc/netplan/50-nosi.yaml -- the concrete config for the
#     datasource-less bare-metal boot, where cloud-init is disabled and
#     the drop-in above never gets rendered. Same nosi-en/nosi-eth ids as
#     the drop-in, so when cloud-init DOES render its own file the two
#     deep-merge cleanly (identical definitions, no duplicate-iface race).
#
# Either way: DHCP on any wired interface matched by NAME GLOB (en*
# predictable + eth* legacy/VM, never by MAC), so the same image works on
# whatever NIC the target box happens to have. We also delete the
# build-VM 50-cloud-init.yaml so its dead pin cannot win on HW. Fedora
# cloud images render via NetworkManager, whose default already DHCPs any
# ethernet, so there the drop-in (for the cloud-init case) plus clearing
# the baked keyfile is the whole fix.
#
# An apt system that uses NetworkManager instead of netplan (Raspberry Pi
# OS) takes that same NM path: NM's default DHCP covers every wired NIC, so
# nosi writes no netplan there, and the cloud-init drop-in is skipped when
# cloud-init is not installed. Both guards key off what is actually present
# (netplan, cloud-init), so the same step stays correct across renderers.
#
# We write config but never `netplan apply`: the build VM keeps its live
# (cloud-init-brought-up) link through the rest of the bake; the new
# config takes effect on the next boot -- first boot on the real box, and
# the smoketest's fresh boot, which validates it.
#
# Idempotent: nosi_write_if_changed rewrites only on content change;
# rm -f no-ops when the file is already absent.

# ---- FreeBSD: NIC-name-agnostic DHCP via rc.conf --------------------------
# FreeBSD has no netplan / cloud.cfg; networking is /etc/rc.conf. The
# ifconfig_DEFAULT pseudo-interface applies to whichever single ethernet
# NIC the box has (vtnet0 in the build VM, em0/igb0/re0/... on bare
# metal), so it is the FreeBSD analog of the Linux en*/eth* glob and just
# as portable across hardware. async DHCP (not SYNCDHCP) mirrors the
# Linux netplan `optional: true` posture: boot does not block on a NIC
# with no carrier. IPv6 via router-advertised SLAAC. sysrc edits rc.conf
# idempotently (replaces, never duplicates), so no nosi_write_if_changed.
# Config-only, no `service netif restart`: the build VM keeps its live
# nuageinit-brought-up link for the rest of the bake; the next boot (the
# operator's first boot, and the smoketest's fresh boot) applies it.
