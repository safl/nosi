# Make sshd ready for login on every shape: drop a config snippet and
# make sure the daemon is enabled (so it comes up on the next boot of a
# flashed image, and right away on a re-run on a live VM).
#
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/00-nosi.conf, two settings:
#   PasswordAuthentication yes
#       Fedora's sshd_config ships with PasswordAuthentication=no by
#       default, which makes the baked `odus:odus.321` credentials
#       useless without an SSH key. Debian / Ubuntu cloud images ship
#       with it on; the drop-in is redundant there but harmless.
#   PermitRootLogin no
#       Defense in depth on top of step 22's `passwd -l root` (cloud-init
#       runcmd). If something rotates the root password later, sshd
#       still won't accept root logins.
#
# Enablement: openssh-server's postinst enables ssh.service on
# Debian/Ubuntu, and Fedora Cloud enables sshd.service via preset, so in
# practice the daemon is already on. We enable it explicitly anyway so
# the "ready for login" guarantee does not depend on those defaults (and
# survives a minimal base or an accidental mask). Unit name differs:
# `ssh` on Debian/Ubuntu, `sshd` on Fedora.
#
# Host-key regen: the bake strips /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* at the very end for
# per-instance identity. On Ubuntu the openssh-server stack's
# ssh-keygen handling eventually regenerates them on first boot (ssh.service
# restart-loops for ~30-60s until a separate path regenerates the keys).
# On Debian Trixie that path does NOT trigger reliably without cloud-init
# running cc_ssh -- a flashed bare-metal box without a NoCloud seed sits
# in a permanent ssh.service restart loop forever (real incident, see
# nosi 2026-05). Fix is a tiny nosi-owned oneshot ordered Before
# ssh.service / ssh.socket that runs `ssh-keygen -A`, which is idempotent
# (only generates missing key types, no-op when keys exist). Pair it with
# a drop-in adding Wants= + After= to ssh.service AND ssh.socket so it
# always runs before either activation path.
#
# Idempotency: nosi_write_if_changed only touches mtime when the content
# differs; enable/unmask are idempotent.
