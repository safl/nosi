# dracut module: bty-ramboot
#
# Install-time hook. Called by ``dracut -f`` (or dracut's automatic
# runs after a kernel update) when 99bty-ramboot is in the module
# list (pulled in by /etc/dracut.conf.d/99-nosi-netboot.conf on
# nosi-baked images). Wires up:
#
#   * kernel modules (nbd, overlay, ext4/xfs/btrfs) so the runtime
#     hooks don't have to modprobe from userspace with a missing
#     dep chain.
#   * userspace binaries (nbd-client + core utilities used by the
#     runtime hooks) baked into the initrd tree.
#   * Three phased hooks driving the ramboot chain:
#
#     - cmdline (priority 10): parse ``bty.nbd=`` off /proc/cmdline
#       and IMMEDIATELY override dracut's ``root`` var so the
#       initqueue doesn't wait for the image's baked ``root=UUID=``
#       (which never appears -- there's no local disk). Also
#       registers ``/dev/nbd0`` as the wait-for device.
#
#     - initqueue/online (priority 20): after ``network`` module
#       has DHCPed the primary NIC, run nbd-client to attach the
#       remote export at /dev/nbd0. Idempotent (touches a sentinel
#       so re-entry of the initqueue no-ops).
#
#     - mount (priority 90): last-mile pivot prep -- overlay the
#       root partition on tmpfs, rewrite /etc/fstab in the overlay
#       upper (drop /boot + /boot/efi), mask systemd-networkd +
#       cloud-init in the overlay upper, propagate DNS. Runs LAST
#       so dracut's own mount hooks have finished by the time we
#       repoint /sysroot at our overlay.
#
# The old single-hook shape ``inst_hook mount 10`` was fundamentally
# wrong: dracut's mount phase never fires when initqueue is stuck
# waiting for the image's baked ``root=UUID=`` (which never appears
# without our NBD attach). Splitting into cmdline+online+mount lets
# each phase do its job in the order dracut actually runs them.

# Runtime deps: base for shell tooling, network-manager for the
# initrd-side DHCP + resolv.conf population that the online hook
# consumes. Fedora 40+ split ``network`` into concrete providers
# (``network-manager``, ``network-legacy``, ``network-wicked``) and
# ``network`` no longer resolves; ``network-manager`` is the
# concrete dep that works on both Fedora 44 and Ubuntu 26.04.

    # Mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service in the SHIPPED initrd.
    # Ubuntu 26.04+ ships dracut with the network + systemd modules
    # that together pull in systemd-networkd-wait-online.service,
    # which then waits 120 s for a network-online.target signal that
    # never fires under nbdboot (our own online hook handles the
    # nbd-client attach after dracut's ``network`` module brought a
    # NIC up via DHCP; nothing in the initrd flips
    # network-online.target). The wait-online.service times out,
    # gives up, and boot moves on, but only after burning the full
    # 120 s right in the initrd critical path.
    #
    # Symlink the unit to /dev/null in the initrd's unit dir so it
    # can never start. ``$initdir`` is the initrd's rootfs at bake
    # time; ``ln -sf`` here writes into the shipped initrd. This is
    # separate from the equivalent mask the mount hook lays down in
    # the overlay upper, which protects the pivoted rootfs.

    # NOTE ON THE ROOT=UUID SITUATION:
    # Ubuntu's cloud-image dracut config bakes root=UUID references into
    # the initrd in three places that keep dracut-initqueue waiting for
    # local disks when the image is netbooted:
    #
    #   /etc/cmdline.d/20-root-dev.conf
    #   /var/lib/dracut/hooks/initqueue/finished/devexists-*.sh
    #   /var/lib/dracut/hooks/emergency/80-*.sh
    #
    # We DON'T strip them here because ``dracut --regenerate-all`` inside
    # the image build (step 34) regenerates the SAME initrd the image
    # boots locally from -- stripping would break the flash-boot path.
    # The netboot bundle packer (cijoe/scripts/netboot_bundle_pack.py)
    # strips these from ONLY the copy it ships in the bundle, so the
    # ramboot path gets the stripped initrd while the local-disk path
    # keeps the pristine one.
