# dracut mount hook for pixie ramboot (priority 90).
#
# Runs after ``pixie-ramboot-online.sh`` has attached /dev/nbd0 and
# after dracut's built-in mount hooks have (attempted to) mount
# /sysroot. Two modes gated on ``pixie.persist=1`` (or the legacy
# ``bty.persist=1``):
#
#   Ephemeral (default): mount the picked partition RO at
#   /run/pixie-lower, tmpfs at /run/pixie-upper, overlayfs at
#   /sysroot. Writes on the target go to RAM and vanish on reboot.
#
#   Persistent (``pixie.persist=1``): mount /dev/nbd0 RW directly at
#   /sysroot. Pixie's persist path spawns qemu-nbd with
#   ``--offset=<partition_1_start_bytes>`` so /dev/nbd0 is the ext4
#   partition at offset 0 (same shape ephemeral gets from nbdkit's
#   ``--filter=partition``). Writes land in the underlying qcow2 and
#   survive reboots. The image's baked /etc/fstab entries for /boot
#   and /boot/efi refer to LABELs / UUIDs on the whole-disk view we
#   are NOT exposing here; systemd-fstab-generator will fail those
#   with a warning and boot proceeds -- /boot on the target is
#   inert in nbdboot mode anyway (pixie serves the kernel).
#
# Both modes:
#
#   * Mask systemd-networkd + NetworkManager + cloud-init on the
#     pivoted rootfs so userspace does not tear down the NIC the
#     initrd owns.
#   * Propagate DNS from dracut's netroot config.
#   * POST a status ping so the pixie appliance can log ramboot.up.

#
# Ubuntu 26.04 ships /etc/resolv.conf as a SYMLINK to

# Two things need to happen for glibc to read our plain resolv.conf:
#
#   1. Blow the symlink away here so the ``cp`` / ``>`` below writes
#      a regular file at /etc/resolv.conf instead of following the
#      symlink into a /run tmpfs target that never gets populated
#      once we mask systemd-resolved.
#   2. Neutralise ``/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd-resolve.conf``'s
#      ``L! /etc/resolv.conf ...`` rule so systemd-tmpfiles-setup on
#      the pivoted rootfs does NOT recreate the symlink at boot,
