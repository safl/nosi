# Runs during dracut's cmdline phase, before ANY device lookups. Its
# only job is to override dracut's baked ``root=UUID=`` with our NBD
# device so the initqueue doesn't sit for 3 minutes waiting for a
# disk UUID that will never appear (there's no local disk in an nbdboot
# nbdboot).
#
# Does NOT do the actual nbd-client attach -- that needs the
# ``network`` module to have brought a NIC up, which happens later
# in the initqueue/online phase. See ``nosi-nbdboot-online.sh``.

# hook runs, and systemd's fstab-generator (also earlier than us)
# emits ``dev-disk-by-uuid-<uuid>.device`` units from it. Redact the
# file so those units never get emitted; the local-disk root= is
# meaningless for nbdboot.
