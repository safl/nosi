deps:
	pipx install cijoe
	pipx ensurepath

# Install the git hooks. pre-commit itself: `pipx install pre-commit`.
# After this, every `git commit` runs ruff (lint+format), shellcheck, and
# the hygiene hooks on the staged files. See .pre-commit-config.yaml.
hooks:
	pre-commit install

# Run the whole hook set over every file (what CI does). Handy before a
# push, or once after `make hooks` to normalise the tree.
lint:
	pre-commit run --all-files

# Build a base. The cijoe pipeline downloads the upstream cloud image,
# resizes it, runs cloud-init in a QEMU VM, snapshots, gzip-publishes,
# and (for bases with a [[...derive]] list) derives their shapes from
# the baked rootfs. Needs qemu-system-x86_64 + KVM; deriving needs sudo
# for qemu-nbd + chroot (and docker for the docker shape).
build:
	cd cijoe && cijoe tasks/build.yaml --monitor -c configs/$(VARIANT).toml

# Raspberry Pi OS (arm64). Not a QEMU bake: loop-mounts the official image and
# runs apply.sh in a chroot (rpi_image_build), then smoketests + packs the
# headless base and the desktop derive. Needs sudo (losetup/mount/chroot) and,
# on an x86 host, binfmt + qemu-user-static; native on an arm64 host. The
# desktop derive rides along (no separate invocation).
build-rpi:
	cd cijoe && cijoe tasks/build-rpi.yaml --monitor -c configs/rpios-13-headless.toml

# Only the bases. ubuntu-2604-wsl / ubuntu-2604-docker / fedora-44-desktop
# are produced by their base's build, not invoked here.
